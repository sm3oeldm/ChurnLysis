# ChurnLysis
End-to-end real-time churn prediction system using game telemetry, ML models, and explainability.

# Real-Time Churn Prediction System

## Goal
Build an end-to-end, event-driven analytics pipeline that predicts customer churn for a multiplayer game using real-time user activity.

## Scope
- Real-time event ingestion via WebSockets
- Data lake for raw event storage
- Feature engineering on behavioral signals
- Machine learning churn prediction
- Model explainability with SHAP
- Dashboard for business stakeholders

## Why this project
This project is designed to simulate a real production ML system, bridging backend engineering, data engineering, and applied machine learning.
